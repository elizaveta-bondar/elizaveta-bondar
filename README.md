# About me

I worked as a lawyer for more than 4 years in litigation support, and I have much experience in law. But at a certain point in my life, I wanted to change careers and chose to be a QA Engineer.

It may not seem obvious, but the reasons for my choice are clear: I formed a critical mind working as a lawyer, and legal work often required "professional pessimism" and a destructive view of the situation. These are exactly the traits and skills that allow testers to ensure the quality of the software product and, as a result, release a high-quality program.

I am incredibly passionate about software testing and expand my knowledge in this area every day. So far I have no experience in the company in this role, but I am confidently going toward my goal to get my first offer ✨
